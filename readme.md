# ConsenSys Style Guide Codified

The ConsenSys style guide codified. Maintained by the [Kauri](https://kauri.io) team.

It uses [Vale](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale), and is based on work by [Test the Docs](https://github.com/testthedocs).

## Usage

To use, clone the repository, and move the _.vale.ini_ file to where you are writing, [you can save it where ever you want](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale/config/#valeini). Update `StylesPath` to the location of where you save the _consensys-styles_ folder which contains the style definitions.

To learn how to use vale, [read the project documentation](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale/usage/) for a full guide.
